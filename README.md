In this repository, we will see how to use a very unique library in python called tpot . 
The reason why this library is unique is that it automates the entire Machine Learning pipeline and 
provides you with the best performing machine learning model. I have used TPOT with various datasets !!!


What is TPOT?
A Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.

TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.


Once TPOT is finished searching (or you get tired of waiting), it provides you with the Python code for the best pipeline it found so you can tinker with the pipeline from there.


Basically, it automatically provides you with the best suited cum optimized model for any given problem using genetic programming.
Well, it's like you train the TPOT model using desired data and it will provide you with the best suited model for the data from the scikit-learn library as it has been built on top of it. This model is highly optimized and brings about the best results.
