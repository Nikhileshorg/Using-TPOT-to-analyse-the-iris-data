In this repository, we will see how to use a very unique library in python called tpot . 
The reason why this library is unique is that it automates the entire Machine Learning pipeline and 
provides you with the best performing machine learning model. I have used TPOT with various datasets !!!


What is TPOT?
A Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.

TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.
